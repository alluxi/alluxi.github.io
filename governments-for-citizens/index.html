				<h2>Governments for citizens</h2>
				<p class="date">Written on Jun 19, 2015</p>
				<p>The US presidential election campaign has begun, as <a href="https://alluxi.eu/a-ground-breaking-candidacy/">you already
know</a>. One of the most
irritating aspects of the entire campaign process are financial muscles.
It appears to the public that candidates are open for purchase. This is
not favourable, nor is it fitting.</p>
<p>The gap between the politicians and the people they are sat to govern
must not great. The result is contempt among the common person against
the rule. This alone is an argument for restricting this kind of
practice in the campaign process.</p>
<p>Donald Trump <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-reveals-net-worth-presidential-campaign-launch">said in his
speech</a>
that he was too rich for purchase. That is solving the problem by the
wrong means. It is simply sending the wrong signals. Politics ought to
be open for everyone to enter.</p>
<p>Maybe are the entire US political system up for debate. This kind of
problems are non-existent in the European political landscape, and as an
added bonus: more than two parties.</p>
<p>The system is flawed â€“ reforms are needed. In the end, the government is
for its citizens, not the other way around.</p>
