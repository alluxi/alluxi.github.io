				<p>The rule of law is paramount in a democracy. In European thinking there
is a similar term called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat"><em>rechtsstaat</em></a>. When the
government adhere to these principles, it is not only about having its
laws current, but also about having just laws, which are morally right.</p>
<p>This bring me to the topic of this post – equal rights. This week the
United Sates’ Supreme Court
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33290341">ruled</a> that same-sex
marriage is a right every American have, regardless of their state and
its legislation concerning the matter.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court could rule on this because of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14<sup>th</sup>
amendment</a> of the
US Constitution. It stipulates that everyone have “the equal protection
of the law”. Equal rights are one of the cornerstones of a rechtsstaat.</p>
<p>It is sad that battles like this are up to nine judges and not the
representatives that are elected by the people for this very job. I have
already <a href="https://alluxi.eu/governments-for-citizens/">pointed out</a> some
of the flaws the American electoral system faces, and this just
emphasises it.</p>
<p>At least this is a step in the right direction.</p>

				<p>The US presidential election campaign has begun, as <a href="https://alluxi.eu/a-ground-breaking-candidacy/">you already
know</a>. One of the most
irritating aspects of the entire campaign process are financial muscles.
It appears to the public that candidates are open for purchase. This is
not favourable, nor is it fitting.</p>
<p>The gap between the politicians and the people they are sat to govern
must not great. The result is contempt among the common person against
the rule. This alone is an argument for restricting this kind of
practice in the campaign process.</p>
<p>Donald Trump <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-reveals-net-worth-presidential-campaign-launch">said in his
speech</a>
that he was too rich for purchase. That is solving the problem by the
wrong means. It is simply sending the wrong signals. Politics ought to
be open for everyone to enter.</p>
<p>Maybe are the entire US political system up for debate. This kind of
problems are non-existent in the European political landscape, and as an
added bonus: more than two parties.</p>
<p>The system is flawed – reforms are needed. In the end, the government is
for its citizens, not the other way around.</p>

				<p>Bernie Sanders is a self-declared democratic socialist, not too much of
a difference from social liberalism, and he is running for president in
the US. That is just astonishing.</p>
<p>One of the main issues he is advocating are income and wealth
inequalities. Some would go as far as to say this is his main objective.</p>
<p>On his <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">campaign website</a>, he uses
the phrase “economic and political oligarchy”. A phrase we often hear in
regards to Russia and their political system and distribution of wealth.
He is really onto something here. The more I think about the statement,
I come to realise it is very much applicable to the American society.</p>
<p>The middle class is going extinct, as he quite rightly so remarks. The
ridiculously wealthy always replies with “someone needs to create jobs”.
That is correct, even the former Norwegian Secretary of International
Development, Erik Solheim, has
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Hoyresiden-har-hatt-rett-6831488.html">admitted,</a>
“Someone needs to get rich before we can lift the masses”. Nota bene;
Erik Solheim is a party member of the Norwegian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Left_Party_(Norway)">Socialist Left
Party</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is not an excuse to get filthy rich and go fighting
against general prosperity. This is a key fact Bernie Sanders has
noticed. After the wealthy have created the jobs, the wealth
redistribution must happen.</p>
<p>Sanders is also talking about universal health care. <a href="https://alluxi.eu/social-liberalism-in-a-nutshell/">I cannot agree
more</a>. The
government’s objective and goal is to make its citizens prosper. This
includes having access to medical services – free of charge or at least
at a rate everyone can afford.</p>
<p>Good luck, Bernie Sanders!</p>

					<h2><a href="/taking-care-of-the-elderly/">Taking care of the elderly</a></h2>
					<p class="date">Written on May 02, 2015</p>
				</header>
				<p>An important element when discussing what the society can do for the
elderly is public pension schemes. When every worker pays a fixed
percentage of the salary every month to the government, they will
benefit from a guaranteed pension later on.</p>
<p>Those who do not have a steady job will receive the minimum pension rate
from the government. This ensures everyone a dignified life of
retirement. The rate must from time to time be adjusted for inflation.</p>
<h3>Nursing homes</h3>
<p>Providing nursing homes for the elderly ought to be a public service.
The elderly must be kept busy in order for them to be happy. This can be
archived by making sure those of the elderly that want it, can establish
an activity club.</p>
<p>To lift some of the financial burden off the state and at the same time
give the elderly a more dignified life, new and existing technology must
be taken in use to let the elderly live home as long as they want and
are able to.</p>
