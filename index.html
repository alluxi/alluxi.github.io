				<p>Jail time must act both deterrent for the potential criminal and as a
security measure for the population as a whole. The key ingredient in
any prison system is rehabilitation. The inmates will be released at
some point, and at that very day must they be ready to live a reformed
life without crime.</p>
<p>To make this happen, there must be a way for the inmates to get on with
their lives. The best way of doing this is to educate them while they’re
in jail and get housing and a job for when they get out. If you simply
release them with nothing, then the way back to crime is not far.</p>
<p>The criminal code must not have too lengthy sentences either. All the
more time being spent behind bars is more time for overall change to
happen in society. Being able to readjust to a life outside of jail is
paramount. If they don’t recognise society anymore and have no clue as
to how things works anymore, there is no chance of living a life without
more crime.</p>
<h3>Sentences without maximum length</h3>
<p>When criminals fall into a pattern of crime without any seeming end to
it, then they should be convicted to imprisonment without a maximum time
limit. This should be used when the crime jeopardizes someone’s life,
well-being or freedom and the risk of them doing it again is imminent.</p>
<p>There must of course be a minimum time served, but being released is
assessed by a judge, with help from expert witnesses, and not something
that can be jotted down in the calendar.</p>
<h3>The death penalty</h3>
<p>Killing people is wrong. No matter who are doing it. The only exception
is self-defence, and then it should be the last resort. Most people can
change. After 20 years incarcerated, change has happened – but only if
the correctional system facilitates change through rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Few people will never change, but to accommodate those, there should be
a life imprisonment. This should be used sparingly as this only applies
to the very few.</p>
<h3>Insanity</h3>
<p>Mentally ill criminals must not be punished for their actions. They
should, just like young children, not be held accountable. They may
however be sentenced to mandatory psychiatric treatment. When their
condition is deemed to be compatible by society, they must be released.</p>
<p>There is a grey area where a mentally ill person know that their action
is wrong. In those cases, punishment must be considered. Being able to
understand that actions have consequences is the absolute line between
being too ill to be punished and having criminal intent.</p>

					<h2><a href="/government-imposed-fees/">Government imposed fees</a></h2>
					<p class="date">Written on Apr 11, 2015</p>

				<p>Taxation is a measure to fund public services, but it can also serve to
discourage non-favourable behaviour. Some activities, like alcohol
consumption and smoking, will impose extra government spending, such as
rehabilitation clinics and cancer surgeries. Other activities doesn’t
impose such extra costs for the government <em>per se</em>, for instance
environmental fees on petrol.</p>
<p>Is this kind of taxation okay? In a social liberal society it is. We
can’t ban everything we deem inappropriate, but we can – and should –
discourage it by taxation. The fees collected by this can be used to
mitigate some of the negative side effects of such actions.</p>
<p>Taxation by fees is a way to only affect those inflicting the
surcharges. However, some services with fees are quite necessary, for
instance medical treatment. These fees must not be too high for people
of low-income. Some countries deal with this problem by having a maximum
sum for patient’s charge pear year in regards to medical services.</p>
<p>Notice the clear distinction of fees used for funding with a maximum
yearly payment and fees used to discourage behaviour – these fees
doesn’t have any limits.</p>
<p>When it comes to value-added tax (VAT), there must be different rates to
accommodate for different types of goods and services. Food should have
a lower rate than services and other goods, because of the necessity of
this. The group that notices VAT the most is the poor. There must be a
social safety net in place to make sure every citizen live in dignified
forms.</p>
<p>Indirect taxation through fees are necessary in order to provide
sufficient funding for the government and as a tool to discourage
non-favourable behaviour, in a society where we can’t ban everything we
don’t like.</p>

					<h2><a href="/social-liberalism-in-a-nutshell/">Social liberalism in a nutshell</a></h2>
					<p class="date">Written on Apr 07, 2015</p>
				</header>
				<p>Social liberalism is at the core about making sure everyone have the
opportunity to succeed and thrive, and at the same time not holding them
back. This is done by ensuring everyone have the same foundations by
having a compulsory, free school system that teaches basic skills, and
that becoming a skilled worker or attending at the university must be
free too, just like to compulsory education.</p>
<p>This will benefit both the individual who receives the education, but
also the corporations and industry as well. The community is not served
with a system where knowledge is a privilege for the rich and wealthy.</p>
<p>With the same foundations in place, it’s important to make sure that
there’s a safety net which catch everyone at times of unemployment,
injury or otherwise. The society must be fair and open to every citizen.
This will reduce crime.</p>
<p>Another important institution is the universal health care system, which
ought to be provided at no cost. This includes subsidized prescription
drugs. Not everyone can afford health services or even insurance – that
is why it must be free.</p>
<p>Liberal socialism must not be confused with communism. The easiest
explanation is that liberal socialism is capitalism with the addition of
a human element. This is called a mixed economy, and its purpose is to
avoid exploitation. The majority of the workforce are employed in
privately owned corporations, despite the big public sector which is in
place to run all the aforementioned services, like schools and health
care facilities.</p>
<p>How does it all get funded? There is nothing like a free lunch. The tax
burden must be relatively high. Being able to compete in a globalised
economy is important, but wouldn’t a high tax burden scare international
corporations from doing business? That depends on what kind of
businesses and corporations we’re discussing.</p>
<p>An educated population is desirable for high tech industry. This kind of
industry will make waves to other parts of the community – creating jobs
elsewhere. The knowledge based economy is the future.</p>
<p>A society based on social liberalism believes that the community is the
key to individual success – and that is social liberalism in a nutshell.</p>
