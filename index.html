				<p>Social liberalism is at the core about making sure everyone have the
opportunity to succeed and thrive, and at the same time not holding them
back. This is done by ensuring everyone have the same foundations by
having a compulsory, free school system that teaches basic skills, and
that becoming a skilled worker or attending at the university must be
free too, just like to compulsory education.</p>
<p>This will benefit both the individual who receives the education, but
also the corporations and industry as well. The community is not served
with a system where knowledge is a privilege for the rich and wealthy.</p>
<p>With the same foundations in place, it’s important to make sure that
there’s a safety net which catch everyone at times of unemployment,
injury or otherwise. The society must be fair and open to every citizen.
This will reduce crime.</p>
<p>Another important institution is the universal health care system, which
ought to be provided at no cost. This includes subsidized prescription
drugs. Not everyone can afford health services or even insurance – that
is why it must be free.</p>
<p>Liberal socialism must not be confused with communism. The easiest
explanation is that liberal socialism is capitalism with the addition of
a human element. This is called a mixed economy, and its purpose is to
avoid exploitation. The majority of the workforce are employed in
privately owned corporations, despite the big public sector which is in
place to run all the aforementioned services, like schools and health
care facilities.</p>
<p>How does it all get funded? There is nothing like a free lunch. The tax
burden must be relatively high. Being able to compete in a globalised
economy is important, but wouldn’t a high tax burden scare international
corporations from doing business? That depends on what kind of
businesses and corporations we’re discussing.</p>
<p>An educated population is desirable for high tech industry. This kind of
industry will make waves to other parts of the community – creating jobs
elsewhere. The knowledge based economy is the future.</p>
<p>A society based on social liberalism believes that the community is the
key to individual success – and that is social liberalism in a nutshell.</p>
