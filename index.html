				<p>Bernie Sanders is a self-declared democratic socialist, not too much of
a difference from social liberalism, and he is running for president in
the US. That is just astonishing.</p>
<p>One of the main issues he is advocating are income and wealth
inequalities. Some would go as far as to say this is his main objective.</p>
<p>On his <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">campaign website</a>, he uses
the phrase “economic and political oligarchy”. A phrase we often hear in
regards to Russia and their political system and distribution of wealth.
He is really onto something here. The more I think about the statement,
I come to realise it is very much applicable to the American society.</p>
<p>The middle class is going extinct, as he quite rightly so remarks. The
ridiculously wealthy always replies with “someone needs to create jobs”.
That is correct, even the former Norwegian Secretary of International
Development, Erik Solheim, has
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Hoyresiden-har-hatt-rett-6831488.html">admitted,</a>
“Someone needs to get rich before we can lift the masses”. Nota bene;
Erik Solheim is a party member of the Norwegian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Left_Party_(Norway)">Socialist Left
Party</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is not an excuse to get filthy rich and go fighting
against general prosperity. This is a key fact Bernie Sanders has
noticed. After the wealthy have created the jobs, the wealth
redistribution must happen.</p>
<p>Sanders is also talking about universal health care. <a href="https://alluxi.eu/social-liberalism-in-a-nutshell/">I cannot agree
more</a>. The
government’s objective and goal is to make its citizens prosper. This
includes having access to medical services – free of charge or at least
at a rate everyone can afford.</p>
<p>Good luck, Bernie Sanders!</p>

					<h2><a href="/taking-care-of-the-elderly/">Taking care of the elderly</a></h2>
					<p class="date">Written on May 02, 2015</p>
				</header>
				<p>An important element when discussing what the society can do for the
elderly is public pension schemes. When every worker pays a fixed
percentage of the salary every month to the government, they will
benefit from a guaranteed pension later on.</p>
<p>Those who do not have a steady job will receive the minimum pension rate
from the government. This ensures everyone a dignified life of
retirement. The rate must from time to time be adjusted for inflation.</p>
<h3>Nursing homes</h3>
<p>Providing nursing homes for the elderly ought to be a public service.
The elderly must be kept busy in order for them to be happy. This can be
archived by making sure those of the elderly that want it, can establish
an activity club.</p>
<p>To lift some of the financial burden off the state and at the same time
give the elderly a more dignified life, new and existing technology must
be taken in use to let the elderly live home as long as they want and
are able to.</p>

					<h2><a href="/universal-subsidised-day-care/">Universal subsidised day-care</a></h2>
					<p class="date">Written on Apr 24, 2015</p>
				</header>
				<p>Being in day-care have several advantages attached to it. For instance,
the child is socialised and gets to play with other children. On top of
this, when parents can work and pay their taxes, everyone wins.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of this welfare service is none, as long as every
day-care facility is affordable. We cannot have a first class service
and a second service level for those who cannot afford it.</p>
<p>The main goals are to get parents to obtain taxable income and get
children to socialise. The last goal is especially important for
children of immigrants. They need to learn the language in order to get
the most out of school later on.</p>
<p>You could have an eligibility requirement, like being low-income and
being in a job or doing job training/education, but is that necessary?
The high-income families pay more in taxes and should benefit from this
scheme as well. This will prevent the different service levels and act
as an equaliser. That is why we need universal subsidised day-care. No
strings attached.</p>

					<h2><a href="/rehabilitation-of-the-prison-population/">Rehabilitation of the prison population</a></h2>
					<p class="date">Written on Apr 17, 2015</p>
				</header>
				<p>Jail time must act both deterrent for the potential criminal and as a
security measure for the population as a whole. The key ingredient in
any prison system is rehabilitation. The inmates will be released at
some point, and at that very day must they be ready to live a reformed
life without crime.</p>
<p>To make this happen, there must be a way for the inmates to get on with
their lives. The best way of doing this is to educate them while they’re
in jail and get housing and a job for when they get out. If you simply
release them with nothing, then the way back to crime is not far.</p>
<p>The criminal code must not have too lengthy sentences either. All the
more time being spent behind bars is more time for overall change to
happen in society. Being able to readjust to a life outside of jail is
paramount. If they don’t recognise society anymore and have no clue as
to how things works anymore, there is no chance of living a life without
more crime.</p>
<h3>Sentences without maximum length</h3>
<p>When criminals fall into a pattern of crime without any seeming end to
it, then they should be convicted to imprisonment without a maximum time
limit. This should be used when the crime jeopardizes someone’s life,
well-being or freedom and the risk of them doing it again is imminent.</p>
<p>There must of course be a minimum time served, but being released is
assessed by a judge, with help from expert witnesses, and not something
that can be jotted down in the calendar.</p>
<h3>The death penalty</h3>
<p>Killing people is wrong. No matter who are doing it. The only exception
is self-defence, and then it should be the last resort. Most people can
change. After 20 years incarcerated, change has happened – but only if
the correctional system facilitates change through rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Few people will never change, but to accommodate those, there should be
a life imprisonment. This should be used sparingly as this only applies
to the very few.</p>
<h3>Insanity</h3>
<p>Mentally ill criminals must not be punished for their actions. They
should, just like young children, not be held accountable. They may
however be sentenced to mandatory psychiatric treatment. When their
condition is deemed to be compatible by society, they must be released.</p>
<p>There is a grey area where a mentally ill person know that their action
is wrong. In those cases, punishment must be considered. Being able to
understand that actions have consequences is the absolute line between
being too ill to be punished and having criminal intent.</p>
