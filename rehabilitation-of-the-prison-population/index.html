				<h2>Rehabilitation of the prison population</h2>
				<p class="date">Written on Apr 17, 2015</p>
				<p>Jail time must act both deterrent for the potential criminal and as a
security measure for the population as a whole. The key ingredient in
any prison system is rehabilitation. The inmates will be released at
some point, and at that very day must they be ready to live a reformed
life without crime.</p>
<p>To make this happen, there must be a way for the inmates to get on with
their lives. The best way of doing this is to educate them while they’re
in jail and get housing and a job for when they get out. If you simply
release them with nothing, then the way back to crime is not far.</p>
<p>The criminal code must not have too lengthy sentences either. All the
more time being spent behind bars is more time for overall change to
happen in society. Being able to readjust to a life outside of jail is
paramount. If they don’t recognise society anymore and have no clue as
to how things works anymore, there is no chance of living a life without
more crime.</p>
<h3>Sentences without maximum length</h3>
<p>When criminals fall into a pattern of crime without any seeming end to
it, then they should be convicted to imprisonment without a maximum time
limit. This should be used when the crime jeopardizes someone’s life,
well-being or freedom and the risk of them doing it again is imminent.</p>
<p>There must of course be a minimum time served, but being released is
assessed by a judge, with help from expert witnesses, and not something
that can be jotted down in the calendar.</p>
<h3>The death penalty</h3>
<p>Killing people is wrong. No matter who are doing it. The only exception
is self-defence, and then it should be the last resort. Most people can
change. After 20 years incarcerated, change has happened – but only if
the correctional system facilitates change through rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Few people will never change, but to accommodate those, there should be
a life imprisonment. This should be used sparingly as this only applies
to the very few.</p>
<h3>Insanity</h3>
<p>Mentally ill criminals must not be punished for their actions. They
should, just like young children, not be held accountable. They may
however be sentenced to mandatory psychiatric treatment. When their
condition is deemed to be compatible by society, they must be released.</p>
<p>There is a grey area where a mentally ill person know that their action
is wrong. In those cases, punishment must be considered. Being able to
understand that actions have consequences is the absolute line between
being too ill to be punished and having criminal intent.</p>
