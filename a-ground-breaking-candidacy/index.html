				<h2>A ground-breaking candidacy</h2>
				<p class="date">Written on Jun 07, 2015</p>
				<p>Bernie Sanders is a self-declared democratic socialist, not too much of
a difference from social liberalism, and he is running for president in
the US. That is just astonishing.</p>
<p>One of the main issues he is advocating are income and wealth
inequalities. Some would go as far as to say this is his main objective.</p>
<p>On his <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">campaign website</a>, he uses
the phrase “economic and political oligarchy”. A phrase we often hear in
regards to Russia and their political system and distribution of wealth.
He is really onto something here. The more I think about the statement,
I come to realise it is very much applicable to the American society.</p>
<p>The middle class is going extinct, as he quite rightly so remarks. The
ridiculously wealthy always replies with “someone needs to create jobs”.
That is correct, even the former Norwegian Secretary of International
Development, Erik Solheim, has
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Hoyresiden-har-hatt-rett-6831488.html">admitted,</a>
“Someone needs to get rich before we can lift the masses”. Nota bene;
Erik Solheim is a party member of the Norwegian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Left_Party_(Norway)">Socialist Left
Party</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is not an excuse to get filthy rich and go fighting
against general prosperity. This is a key fact Bernie Sanders has
noticed. After the wealthy have created the jobs, the wealth
redistribution must happen.</p>
<p>Sanders is also talking about universal health care. <a href="https://alluxi.eu/social-liberalism-in-a-nutshell/">I cannot agree
more</a>. The
government’s objective and goal is to make its citizens prosper. This
includes having access to medical services – free of charge or at least
at a rate everyone can afford.</p>
<p>Good luck, Bernie Sanders!</p>
