				<h2>Government imposed fees</h2>
				<p class="date">Written on Apr 11, 2015</p>
				<p>Taxation is a measure to fund public services, but it can also serve to
discourage non-favourable behaviour. Some activities, like alcohol
consumption and smoking, will impose extra government spending, such as
rehabilitation clinics and cancer surgeries. Other activities doesn’t
impose such extra costs for the government <em>per se</em>, for instance
environmental fees on petrol.</p>
<p>Is this kind of taxation okay? In a social liberal society it is. We
can’t ban everything we deem inappropriate, but we can – and should –
discourage it by taxation. The fees collected by this can be used to
mitigate some of the negative side effects of such actions.</p>
<p>Taxation by fees is a way to only affect those inflicting the
surcharges. However, some services with fees are quite necessary, for
instance medical treatment. These fees must not be too high for people
of low-income. Some countries deal with this problem by having a maximum
sum for patient’s charge pear year in regards to medical services.</p>
<p>Notice the clear distinction of fees used for funding with a maximum
yearly payment and fees used to discourage behaviour – these fees
doesn’t have any limits.</p>
<p>When it comes to value-added tax (VAT), there must be different rates to
accommodate for different types of goods and services. Food should have
a lower rate than services and other goods, because of the necessity of
this. The group that notices VAT the most is the poor. There must be a
social safety net in place to make sure every citizen live in dignified
forms.</p>
<p>Indirect taxation through fees are necessary in order to provide
sufficient funding for the government and as a tool to discourage
non-favourable behaviour, in a society where we can’t ban everything we
don’t like.</p>
